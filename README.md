* Find all the faces that appear in a picture:
* Get the locations and outlines of each person’s eyes, nose, mouth and chin.
* Recognize who appears in each photo.
* You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:
* pip3 install face_recognition
* When you install face_recognition, you get a simple command-line program
called face_recognition that you can use to recognize faces in a
photograph or folder full for photographs.
* If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.
You can do that with the --tolerance parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:
* There’s one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated
with the filename and the name of the person found.
An unknown_person is a face in the image that didn’t match anyone in
your folder of known people.
* If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don’t
care about file names, you could do this:
